To write a C-program to implement the producer â€“ consumer problem using
semaphores.
ALGORITHM:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Declare the required variables.
Step 3: Initialize the buffer size and get maximum item you want to produce.
Step 4: Get the option, which you want to do either producer, consumer or exit from the
operation.
Step 5: If you select the producer, check the buffer size if it is full the producer should not
produce the item or otherwise produce the item and increase the value buffer size.
Step 6: If you select the consumer, check the buffer size if it is empty the consumer should not
consume the item or otherwise consume the item and decrease the value of buffer size.
Step 7: If you select exit come out of the program.
Step 8: Stop the program.
